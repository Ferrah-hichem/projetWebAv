# projetWebAv
my first take on a fullstack web project
Back folder is for backend (Java + spring) and Front Folder is for frontend(VueJs)
you can download the project and you can launch it.
use this command line to run the back while being inside the back folder  './' = 'back/' : gradlew bootrun
use this command line to run the front while being inside the back folder  './' = 'back/' : npm run serve
